# Game-Of-Thrones-Battle-API

Created APIs /list, /count, /search

Didn't complete /stats API creation, since I wasn't sure based on what criteria to fetch status:
should I get the record based on the number of battles attacker King has participated in 
Or the record that represents the attacker_king and defender_king who participated in more battles
Or the record which represents the location in which attacker_king and defender_king done more battles.

/search API will process the request parameters as in the given 2 cases
